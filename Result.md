NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is a leading player in the semiconductor industry, specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The company has established a strong market presence, particularly in the gaming and AI sectors, where demand continues to surge.

**2. Current Market Position:**
As of 2023, NVIDIA holds approximately 80% of the discrete GPU market share, significantly ahead of competitors like AMD (15%) and Intel (minor share).
